A few changes came around this time:

1. Users are validated for uniqueness constraints on their email
2. To become a persons manager, you simply go to the user page and click the manage button next to their name, to
   undo it click the unmanage button it turned into.
3. you can become your own manager so that you can assign yourself tasks if you would like
4. when you create a task rather than entering a user_id, you are now presented with a drop down bar of all the
   users you manage by their name
5. When you go to the feed you can see all of the tasks of your suboordinates, even if a different manager created
   the task for them.
6. When a person looks at a task that is assigned to them they will have a button to log time, it will add a time
   stamp of the current time. The next time they do it, it will close that work session, but they can log as many
   sessions as they would like. No manual entry can be done to prevent cheating.
7. Managers and the worker that is assigned to the task will have buttons to edit, or delete it. Unrelated users
   can only view them through the view-tasks button
8. The view task button serves as a way to view all tasks even if they aren't assigned to you. If they aren't, you
   can only view, not edit or delete
9. Going to a users page displays a list of suboordinates and managers, in the case of self management, this is shown
   too.â€‹
